This project was an individual attempt at the Rossmann store sales competition, before I realised that autoencoders cannot be used for prediction in this task. However, this is still an implementation of an autoencoder, with multiple encoder and decoder layers, using Python that gets validation scores of 99.97%. 

This repository also includes a version of the same autoencoder that uses image representations of the data as inputs, and a file for the preprocessing of the data, which I found was adequate for the competition.
